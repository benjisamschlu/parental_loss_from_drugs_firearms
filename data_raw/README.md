Table 10 refers to female fertility and contains birth (and fertility rates) by age group of mother.
Table 11 refers to male fertility and contains birth (and fertility rates) by age group of father.
Checked for all available years for these two tables for the US over the different reports. 
Available years are 2006, 2008, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2019.

Downloaded the two tables in Excel format for these years.
